    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    let players2 = players.slice();
    players2[3] = 'connie';
    console.log(players2, players);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    let players3 = [].concat(players);
    players3[3] = 'connie';
    console.log(players3, players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    let players4 = [...players];
    players4[3] = 'connie';
    console.log(players4, players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    let players5 = Array.from(players);
    players5[3] = 'connie';
    console.log(players5, players);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes',
      social: {
        facebook: 'wesbos',
        twitter:'@wes'
      }
    };
    let copy = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99});
    copy.number = 100;
    console.log(copy, person);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    // Poor man copy
    const person2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
    person2.social.twitter = '@coolman';
    console.log(person2, person);
